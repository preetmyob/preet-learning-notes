# Chapter 3

## Subdomains

- Core domain is a subdomain (the most important one)
- Clear area of business expertise providing a solution to the core domain 
- its own bounded context
- can be supporting or generic
- avoid making generic subdomains into a core one
- consider a subdomain as a language element for discussing the core domain
- an unbounded subdomain is effectively a big ball of mud
- subdomain/subdomain boundary should be mapped using context maps
