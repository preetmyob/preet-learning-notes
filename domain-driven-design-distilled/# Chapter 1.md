## Problems

- Data models/analysis are given priority over business process
- persistence tied to techincal proceses not business process
- over generalisation vs future needs
- coupling wrt busines process interdependence and data reconciliation  

## Effective design

There is always modelling either using minimal using base intellect or from maximum cognition, and software can be developed from either - like any other build!

Since there is always modeling, there is either a nod to good (thoughtful) good design, or to basd design. In software we should lean on both in a form of effective design

| Strategic design | Tactical Design |

| Bounded context| Aggregrates |
| Subdomains| value  objects|

Bounded Contexts communicate through domain events
